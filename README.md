# CS466-Genome-Alignment-Project

### Introduction: ###
One of the main uses of the sequence alignment technique is to construct phylogenetic trees, which depicts the evolutionary relationships between different species. In our project, we will compare the result of an alignment between certain gene sequences of a cat and a tiger and the alignment between the gene sequences of a dog and a tiger. We expect the cat and the tiger alignment to have a higher score and be better aligned, as a cat and tiger likely have a more recent common ancestor than a dog and a tiger and are also in a common family (Felidae). We ran these tests on the gene ATP8, ND1, ND3, and ND4L.

### Findings: ###
Gene alignment score is consistently higher for cat and tiger than dog and tiger.
